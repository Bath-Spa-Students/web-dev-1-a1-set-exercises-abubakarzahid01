                <p class="shaded-specific-paragraph">2067, humanity is facing extinction following a global famine caused by ecocide.[8] Cooper's family, which includes his children, Tom and Murph, and his father-in-law Donald, engage in farming, like most of humanity. One evening, during a dust storm, Cooper and Murph discover a gravitational anomaly in Murph's bedroom that left patterns of falling particles. The pattern resolves into GPS coordinates, which lead Cooper and Murph to the secret facility of NASA, believed to have shut down.

                    NASA's mission is to find a habitable planet beyond the solar system. A team is preparing to travel through a wormhole near Saturn leading to a galaxy with three potentially habitable planets, based on data from three probe missions, each orbiting the supermassive blackhole Gargantua. Dr. Brand, lead scientist, asks Cooper to pilot due to his experience. Cooper struggles with leaving his children behind, but promises Murph that he will return. Heartbroken, Murph refuses to say goodbye. The Endurance spacecraft takes off with three other NASA scientists − Romilly, Doyle, and Brand's daughter Amelia − as well as two intelligent robots, TARS and CASE.
                    
                    A couple of years later, the crew enters the wormhole and arrives at the first planet to find an ocean world with massive tidal waves. Doyle is swept away and killed. Cooper and Amelia wait for water to drain from the craft and return to the Endurance, where 23 years have passed for Romilly due to time dilation.
                    
                    On Earth in 2094, an adult Murph helps Dr. Brand with an equation to solve the problem of mass exodus — transporting Earth's population off the planet. On his deathbed, Brand reveals that the crew's goal was to colonize another planet rather than return with data that would help the existing population. Murph, despite wondering if Cooper knowingly abandoned her, continues to work on the problem.</p>
